- 👋 Hi, I’m @codefossil
- 👀 I’m interested in constructing book roadmap to some special subject, 

    it must be classic, simple, from introduction to some depth.
    
    Now the subject is limited, including giving a optimal solution to [create awesome product](https://github.com/codefossil/productbook/blob/main/product.md), and [implement it with great software system](https://github.com/codefossil/productbook/blob/main/design.md) with many people [cooperated with each other](https://github.com/codefossil/productbook/blob/main/project.md). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to [be better live in the world](https://github.com/codefossil/livingbook).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on running business to make money with product.
